		A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the even-toed ungulate family Suidae. Pigs include the domestic pig and 
		its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), along with other species. Related creatures outside the genus 
		include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. 
		Juvenile pigs are known as piglets.Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.
		With around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domestic pig is among the most populous large mammals in the 
		world.Pigs are omnivores and can consume a wide range of food.Pigs are biologically similar to humans and are thus 
		frequently used for human medical research.

		<h3>Distribution and evolution </h3>
		<p> With around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domestic pig is one of the most numerous large mammals on the planet.
		The ancestor of the domestic pig is the wild boar, which is one of the most numerous and widespread large mammals. Its 
		many subspecies are native to all but the harshest climates of continental Eurasia and its islands and Africa as well, from 
		Ireland and India to Japan and north to Siberia.
		Long isolated from other pigs on the many islands of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, pigs have evolved into many 
		different species, including wild boar, bearded pigs, and warty pigs. Humans have introduced pigs into Australia, North and 
		South America, and numerous islands, either accidentally as escaped domestic pigs which have gone feral, or as wild boar.</p>

		<h3>Habitat and reproduction </h3>
		<p> 
		The wild pig (Sus scrofa) can take advantage of any forage resources. Therefore, it can live in virtually any productive habitat 
		that can provide enough water to sustain large mammals such as pigs. If there is increased foraging of wild pigs in certain 
		areas, it can cause a nutritional shortage which can cause the pig population to decrease. If the nutritional state returns to 
		normal, the pig population will most likely rise due to the pigs' naturally increased reproduction rate.
		</p>
		<p>Domesticated pigs, especially miniature breeds, are commonly kept as pets.[17] Domestic pigs are raised commercially as 
		livestock; materials that are garnered include their meat (known as pork), leather, and their bristly hairs which are used to 
		make brushes. Because of their foraging abilities and excellent sense of smell, they are used to find truffles in many 
		European countries. Both wild and feral pigs are commonly hunted.
		The relatively short, stiff, coarse hairs of the pig are called bristles, and were once so commonly used in paintbrushes that in 
		1946 the Australian Government launched Operation Pig Bristle. In May 1946, in response to a shortage of pig bristles for 
		paintbrushes to paint houses in the post-World War II construction boom, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flew in 28 
		short tons of pig bristles from China, their only commercially available source at the time.</p>

			<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
			<p>known by other terms that erroneously, disproportionately describe size—is used to refer to small breeds of domestic pig, 
			such as pot-bellied pigs, Göttingen minipigs, Juliana pigs, Choctaw Hogs,Pennywell miniature or kunekunes (and specimens derived 
			by cross-breeding with these). Notable features of most miniature pigs distinguishing them from other pigs may be defined by their
			possession of small,perked-back ears, a potbelly, swayed back, chubby figure, rounded head, short snout, legs, and neck, and a short 
			tail with thick hair at the end.Typically, most breeds of mini pigs will range from the minimum weight of 50 pounds (23 kg) to 200 pounds (91 kg)
